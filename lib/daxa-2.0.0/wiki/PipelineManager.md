# PipelineManager

As Daxa is designed to be a GPU-driven centric API, we provide some code which is meant to be used within your shaders. This is in the form of `.inl` files, such as the core `daxa/daxa.inl`, as well as the newer `daxa/utils/task_graph.inl`.

As such, Daxa provides the PipelineManager util which is meant to be used in the development phase of your app, in order to very quickly iterate on your GPU code.

PipelineManager is mainly designed on top of [Khronos' glslang library](https://github.com/khronosGroup/glslang), providing GLSL to SPIR-V compilation. However, PipelineManager doesn't generate SPIR-V for you to feed to Daxa's Pipeline API. PipelineManager completely manages the pipelines for you. It does this because this way it can do much more for you, such as:

 - Hot reloading (with #include dependency tracking)
 - #includes of files, with line numbered error messages
 - Virtual files

## Usage

In order to use the PipelineManager, just include the corresponding util header, and construct one with a Daxa device.

```cpp
#include <daxa/utils/pipeline_manager.hpp>

// ...

daxa::PipelineManager pipeline_manager = daxa::PipelineManager({
    .device = device,
    .name = "pipeline_manager",
});
```

Once you have a pipeline manager, you can start making pipelines! In order to create a pipeline, the minimum amount of input the pipeline manager needs is the `.source` field of the `.shader_info` field. Let's create a compute pipeline since those are simpler than raster pipelines, and the additional configuration for raster pipelines is identical to what's necessary in the core Daxa API - so it's not unique to the PipelineManager.

```cpp
auto compilation_result = pipeline_manager.add_compute_pipeline(/* daxa::ComputePipelineCompileInfo */{
    .shader_info = /* daxa::ShaderCompileInfo */ {.source = /* ... */},
    .name = "compute_pipeline",
});
```

This `.source` field is a variant. It can be a path to a file `daxa::ShaderFile`, a raw string of code `daxa::ShaderCode`, or raw SPIR-V binary `daxa::ShaderByteCode`. Providing a SPIR-V binary negates most of the utility of the PipelineManager, but is available if you need it. The other two are extremely useful. First, we'll start by just passing in a string of code.

```cpp
auto compilation_result = pipeline_manager.add_compute_pipeline({
    .shader_info = {.source = daxa::ShaderCode{.string = R"glsl(

        layout(local_size_x = 1, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;
        void main()
        {
        }

    )glsl"}},
    .name = "compute_pipeline",
});
```

This is the simplest compute shader that will compile in GLSL. Once this compiles, `pipeline_manager` will construct a `daxa::ComputePipeline` for you, store it internally, and return back a `daxa::Result<std::shared_ptr<daxa::ComputePipeline>>`. This is wrapped in a result since the compilation may fail, which we may want to check.

```cpp
if (compilation_result.is_err())
{
    std::cerr << "Failed to compile the compute_pipeline!\n";
    std::cerr << compilation_result.message() << std::endl;
    return -1;
}
```

Now we can just store our shared pointer to the compute pipeline, and use it however we like!

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<daxa::ComputePipeline> compute_pipeline = compilation_result.value();
```

PipelineManager is the owning container of all these pipelines, which is why we only give the user a shared pointer to the underlying object. This way, PipelineManager can modify the pipeline without the user needing to explicitly modify each pipeline.
> Note: this design decision is mainly due to pipeline manager being a utility designed around developing your application, not for shipping it!

### Hot Reloading
The biggest feature of PipelineManager is the hot-reloading. When the shader code is changed and saved, it will recompile the pipeline. You can even `#include` headers in your shaders, and when the code in those files is updated, the PipelineManager will automatically recompile the affected pipelines for you.

In order to use hot-reloading, we could demonstrate this by adding a `#include` to our `ShaderCode` string. Instead, to more directly demonstrate them, we're going to use either real or virtual files. We'll be going over both in this document, but let's start with real files. We'll create a simple Daxa project structured like so:

```
my_daxa_project/
  |- src/
  |  |- main.cpp
  |  |- main.glsl
  |- CMakeLists.txt
  | ...
```
> Note: we'll also be using the `my_daxa_project/` directory as the CWD when launching the application. This is important since all relative paths will be relative to the CWD. To be extra clear, with this CWD, we'll be able to address the CMakeLists.txt file by saying `./CMakeLists.txt`.

Now, in order to use `main.glsl` as our shader source file, we just need to give it's path to the `ShaderCompileInfo` when adding a new pipeline, so we'll do that instead. Since we want to use a relative path, we'll say `.source = daxa::ShaderFile{"src/main.glsl"}`. If we didn't specify the full relative path, then our error check from earlier would print the following:
```
Failed to compile the compute_pipeline!
could not find file :"main.glsl"
```

Alternatively to providing the full relative path, we can actually modify our PipelineManager to use our `src/` folder as a root look-up path for both source files and #includes by filling the `.root_paths` field in the PipelineManager creation info.

```cpp
daxa::PipelineManager pipeline_manager = daxa::PipelineManager({
    .device = device,
    .shader_compile_options = {
        // src is now a root lookup path!
        .root_paths = {
            "src",
        },
    },
    .name = "pipeline_manager",
});

auto compilation_result = pipeline_manager.add_compute_pipeline({
    // so now we can just say
    .shader_info = {.source = daxa::ShaderFile{"main.glsl"}},
    .name = "compute_pipeline",
});
```

Now that we have a pipeline built on a real file, we can look at the hot-reloading. In our application loop, we just need to call `.reload_all()` on our PipelineManager.

```cpp
while (true) {
    // ...

    auto reloaded_result = pipeline_manager.reload_all();

    // ...
}
```

This `.reload_all()` function returns a result variant, which you can use to check the result of the reload. This function doesn't necessarily actually do anything except check the timestamps of the files in the tracked dependency graph, so it can actually be the case that it returns a `daxa::NoPipelineChanged` value.

```cpp
if (auto reload_err = std::get_if<daxa::PipelineReloadError>(&reloaded_result))
    std::cout << "Failed to reload " << reload_err->message << '\n';
if (auto _ = std::get_if<daxa::PipelineReloadSuccess>(&reloaded_result))
    std::cout << "Successfully reloaded!\n";
```

If we were to modify our `main.glsl` shader file while this application was running, the pipeline manager would automatically recompile `compute_pipeline` for us, with no developer intervention. This is extremely useful for iteration times, since you can change your shaders as much as you like while the application is running. If the shader failed to compile, then the pipeline will not be modified, and thus will continue to use the old *working* version.

Now is a good time to mention the Daxa shader files, which you can and should #include in your shaders for ease of development. These are in the Daxa include directory, but this can be hard to find when using Daxa as a vcpkg dependency. To remedy this, the Daxa CMake package provides a C++ #define which has the full path to the Daxa include directory: `DAXA_SHADER_INCLUDE_DIR`. We can add this to our `.root_paths` in order to allow us to `#include` the Daxa headers in our shaders.

```cpp
.root_paths = {
    DAXA_SHADER_INCLUDE_DIR,
    "src",
},
```

Once we have this root path, we can change our `main.glsl` file like so!
```cpp
#include <daxa/daxa.inl>

layout(local_size_x = 1, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;
void main()
{
}
```

More about Daxa's shader integration (how this header is useful) can be found [here](https://github.com/Ipotrick/Daxa/tree/master/wiki/ShaderIntegration.md).

The last thing to mention for PipelineManager is the ability to register virtual files.

You can call `.add_virtual_file()` on a PipelineManager, providing a name and contents.

```cpp
pipeline_manager.add_virtual_file({
    .name = "my_file",
    .contents = R"glsl(
        // ...
    )glsl",
});
```

To make an update to the virtual file's contents, all you need to do is `.add_virtual_file()` with the same exact name string.

Here's what it would look like if we had both a virtual file for the main source file (`my_file`), as well as a virtual include file (`my_include`)!

```cpp
pipeline_manager.add_virtual_file({
    .name = "my_include",
    .contents = R"glsl(
        #pragma once
        #define MY_INCLUDE_DEFINE
    )glsl",
});

pipeline_manager.add_virtual_file({
    .name = "my_file",
    .contents = R"glsl(
        // Here we can 
        #include <my_include>

        #ifndef MY_INCLUDE_DEFINE
        #error This should NOT happen
        #endif

        layout(local_size_x = 1, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;
        void main() {
        }
    )glsl",
});

auto compilation_result = pipeline_manager.add_compute_pipeline({
    // Here we supply the path to the file, but our virtual file look-up
    // matches, and so the virtual file is used instead!
    .shader_info = {.source = daxa::ShaderFile{"my_file"}},
    .name = APPNAME_PREFIX("compute_pipeline"),
});
```
