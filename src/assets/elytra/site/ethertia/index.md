# Ethertia. <small>An Alpha Dream.</small>


_My 1st Generation VoxelSystem. (total 3)_

I am very missing 2011 sometimes. I like Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 so much. keen of it.

The Name Ethertia, is from Aether/Ether - A dimension of Classic Minecraft that had been 
cancelled. and the great Ethernet, which fulfilled numerous brilliant things. 

and, Aether, 
a mysterious classical element that permeated all throughout space. - according to ancient medieval science.  
Some people believe, the Aether Dimension actual exists, just need a secret way to get access.  
Now, I feel it, I need simulate it. <!--before I die.-->

And. the most important, is. Eldaria Island (an epic map, Minecraft, 2012). 
This is a profound map for me. It means a lot.

(the suffix is from Inertia. -tia. the word and it's concept impressed me.)


## My 'Final Fantasy'

My final dream, is, like an Ideal VoxelSystem/ World.

I often immersed in some Artworks & Films. imagining, sitting on an old train, at nightfall.
the slight sound of railroad tracks swept across the field,
deep orange sunset rays cast in through the window.

Or, living in an ancient town, where a huge world-tree holding in the center of the town.


## Technical Planning.

Fantasy VoxelSystemDev, I know it's literally 'Impossible' for me. 
But, one of the reason why I living, just for the development.   
so I am planning 3 Generation of the Voxel System.

**Generation 1** _Ethertia_ - Classic Alpha: 
- Blocky, Cubical Chunks. Unified Grids.
- Explore of Terrain Generation. 
- Be little know of basic functionalities e.g. Fluid, Block-Entity, Entities. Biomes. 
- Physics: AABB-Clip & simple motion. Graphics: classical.

**Generation 2**: - Further Explore.
- Smoothly. SurfaceNets Isosurface with LOD. Unified Grids. LargeScale Terrain.
- Physics: use of BulletPhys. Graphics: advanced.

**Generation 3**: Ender Fantasy.
- Smoothly & Sharp. Dual Contouring with LOD. Octree Struct. LargeScale Terrain.
- Unknown Technology: that supports delicated details with little spacial complexity 
  (Gradient might introduced, not batch of tiny blocks). and the historical modifies 
  shouldn't affect the performance. (not endless record of SDFs)
